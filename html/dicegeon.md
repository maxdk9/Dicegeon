Hi! Thanks for checking out my game. The name is a work-in-progress…
I have been too lazy to add a tutorial so far, the game is pretty simple but here’s what you need to know:
- Each turn the enemies roll their dice and attack
- Then you roll your dice! Click on a die to lock it between rerolls.
- You get 3 rolls total
- Use your dice to block damage, hit enemies, heal, cast spells!
- Incoming damage is in yellow
- Swords can only target "forward" enemies
- Click on one of your heroes on the left, then click on the icons that show up to find out what they do
- If you win a fight, all your people get healed and resurrected and you get to level one of them up ready for the next fight
